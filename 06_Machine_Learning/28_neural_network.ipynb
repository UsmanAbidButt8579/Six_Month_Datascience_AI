    "# Simple Neural Network Using Scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction. Today, I will explore the sklearn.neural_network module. This module implements the MLP algorithm that can train models to solve both classification and regression problems. MLP stands for Multi-layer Perceptron. It is a supervised learning algorithm that learns a function by training on a dataset. Given a set of features and a target, it can learn a non-linear function approximator for either classification or regression. It is different from logistic regression, in that between the input and the output layer, there can be one or more non-linear layers, called hidden layers.\n",

    "Let's have a look on MLPclassifier first."
